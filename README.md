The project aims to help self-driving cars to identify traffic signs, specifically to determine whether there are "STOP" signs in street view photos. It uses the Convolutional Neural Network as a feature generator, and trains the output layer. It is implemented using PyTorch's framework and Computer Vision Learning Studio (CV Studio).
